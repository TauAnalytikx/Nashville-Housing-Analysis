##Insights 
The processed and modified **Nashville Housing** dataset can be leveraged to extract valuable insights into various aspects of the **real estate market.** These insights encompass **trends in property sales, price segmentation, ownership patterns, and other significant factors. By sorting properties into different price ranges, analyzing property sales trends over time, and examining the impact of ownership changes, these examples offer a deeper understanding of the dynamics within the Nashville housing market.** Through careful data manipulation and analysis, we can derive key insights such as:

- **Property Sales Trends**: Volume of property sales has steadily inreased over time with a sudden bump in 2015 shedding light on market activity which could be due to increase in disposable income and a steady movement in interest rates by the Fed during that time.
Property business seems does not have observable seasonal variations. The period 2010 to 2012 showed a bit of slow numbers which could be due to the 2008-2009 economic slump 
  
- **Price Segmentation**: Categorizing properties into groups such as 'Affordable,' 'Mid-Range,' and 'Luxury' based on their sale prices. Majority of condos are not cheap and the most expensive land use at $12.5m being a church 

- **Ownership Patterns**: Nashville has one of the more expensive housing with a median income. Most properties is in the hands of LCCs than individuals

- **Market Segmentation**: Single-family homes do make a greater majority of home sales, a good opportunity for any developer and real estate investor

These examples lay the groundwork for real estate professionals, policymakers, and investors to make well-informed decisions based on a comprehensive understanding of the Nashville housing market. The insights derived can guide strategic investments, and urban planning, and assist homebuyers in identifying opportunities in specific areas. By harnessing the power of data, we can gain a deeper understanding of Nashvilleâ€™s evolving real estate landscape.
